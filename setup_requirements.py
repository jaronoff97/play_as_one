This script is a helper to select a requirement file based on some operating
system or architecture conditions. To use this script create a requirements
directory with a base.txt requirements file that contains common os-
independent requirements, and one requirement file for each OS/arch-specific
that contains at least this line at the top to always include the base
requirements::

  -r base.txt

To have a single pip command that uses the specific requirements file use this
in a shell script for posix OS::

  pip install -r $(select_requirements.py)

On windows, create a bat of cmd file that loads the windows-specific
requirements directly::

  for /f %%i in ('python select_requirements.py') do (set req_file="%%i")
  pip install -r %req_file%
